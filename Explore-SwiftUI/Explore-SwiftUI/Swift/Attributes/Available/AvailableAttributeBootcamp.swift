    Apply this attribute to an import declaration to import that module with changes to its access control that simplify testing the moduleâ€™s code. Entities in the imported module that are marked with the internal access-level modifier are imported as if they were declared with the public access-level modifier. Classes and class members that are marked with the internal or public access-level modifier are imported as if they were declared with the open access-level modifier.
